# Simon Says Game

The **Simon Says Game** is a memory and pattern recognition game where the player has to follow an ever-increasing sequence of colored buttons. The game progressively gets harder as the player advances through levels.

## Game Rules:
1. **At the start**, Simon (the game) will display a random sequence of colored buttons.
2. The player must **repeat the sequence exactly** by clicking on the same colored buttons in the same order.
3. If the player repeats the sequence correctly, **Simon will add another color** to the sequence.
4. The game continues until the player makes a mistake, at which point the game will end.
5. The **highest score** (level) will be stored and displayed for the player to track their progress.

## How to Play:
1. **Start the Game**: Press any key on your keyboard to start the game.
2. **Follow the Sequence**: Observe the colors being flashed on the screen. The sequence will get longer as you progress through the levels.
3. **Repeat the Sequence**: Click on the colored buttons in the exact same order that Simon displayed. Each correct button click will add another color to the sequence.
4. **Game Over**: If you click the wrong button, the game will be over. Press any key to restart the game.
5. **Highest Score**: The highest level reached will be stored in your browserâ€™s local storage, allowing you to track your progress even after refreshing the page.

## Features:
1. **Smooth User Experience**: Buttons flash when the sequence is shown, and they scale slightly on hover for a more interactive feel.
2. **Game Over Handling**: After a mistake, the game displays a "Game Over" message and prompts the player to restart by pressing any key.
3. **High Score Tracking**: The highest score (level reached) is saved and displayed at the bottom of the game screen, even if the page is refreshed.
